We're trying to defeat the Daleks, not start a jumble sale! Your ideas are too narrow and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot. Susan and I are wanderers in the fourth dimension of time and space. I am so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle art of fisticuffs.

When I say run, run, RUN! Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you astray? Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority. Me, Iâ€™m allowed everywhere.



Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! Rude and not ginger. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother!
